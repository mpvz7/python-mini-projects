Once upon a time, in a small village by the river, there lived a kind and humble fisherman. 
Every day, he would go to the river to catch fish for his family. The fisherman loved his work, 
and the villagers loved him for his generosity.

One day, while fishing, he caught a golden fish. To his surprise, the fish spoke! 
"Please let me go, and I will grant you three wishes," said the golden fish.

The fisherman, astonished, released the fish back into the river. He went home and told his wife 
about the magical fish and the wishes. Together, they decided to ask for a bigger house, 
more food for the village, and a peaceful life for everyone.

The golden fish kept its promise, and the village prospered. From that day forward, the fisherman 
was known as the luckiest man in the village.
