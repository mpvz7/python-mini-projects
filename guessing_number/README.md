# Guessing Game

The Guessing Game is a Python project where the program randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess what it is. The program provides feedback whether the guessed number is too high or too low, helping the user narrow down the possible answers.

## Features

- Randomly generates a secret number.
- Provides hints if the guess is too high or too low.
- Allows the user to continue guessing until the correct number is found.
- Tracks the number of guesses made by the user.

## How to Play

1. Run the script to start the game.
2. Enter your guess when prompted.
3. The program will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. Continue guessing until you find the secret number.
5. You can quit at any time by entering a specific keyword (like `q`).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Running the Program

To run the Guessing Game, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Example

```bash
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!

I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. Can you guess it?

Enter your guess (or 'q' to quit): 50
Too high.

Enter your guess (or 'q' to quit): 25
Too high.

Enter your guess (or 'q' to quit): 12

Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.
